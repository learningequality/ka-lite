Feature: Coach reports
    In order to test the features of coach reports
    Coaches should be able to view relevant information
    about their students.

    Scenario: No data is present
        Given there is no data
        And I am on the coach report
        Then I should see a warning
        And there should be no Show Tabular Report button

    Scenario: I teach two groups
        Given there are two groups
        And I am on the coach report
        When I click on the dropdown button under the Group label
        Then I should see the list of two groups that I teach
        And I should see the option of selecting all groups
        When I select the preferred group
        Then I should see the contents of the summary change according to the group selected

    Scenario: I want to see all the relevant data
        Given there are three learners
        And all learners have completed ten exercises
        And I am on the coach report
        When I click on the Show Tabular Report button
        Then I should see the tabular report
        And there should be three learner rows displayed
        And there should be ten exercise columns displayed
        And I should see a Hide Tabular Report button

    Scenario Outline: I want to read student data from the tabular report
        Given the "<learner>" "<progress verbs>" an "<exercise>"
        And I am on the tabular report
        Then I should see the "<exercise>" marked for "<learner>" as "<progress text>" and coloured "<progress colour>"

    Examples: Learners
        | learner | progress verbs | progress text | progress colour | exercise            |
        | some    | attempted      | 50%           | light blue      | topic0-0-exercise-0 |
        | all     | completed      | None          | dark green      | topic0-0-exercise-1 |
        | struggle| struggling     | 30%           | red             | topic0-0-exercise-2 |

        Given I am on the tabular report
        When I click on the partial colored cell
        Then I should see the detail panel emerge from beneath the row

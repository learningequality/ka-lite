`Khan Academy <http://www.khanacademy.org/>`__'s core mission is to
"provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere", and as `70%
of the world's population is without access to the
internet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage>`__,
primarily in the developing world, providing an alternative delivery
mechanism for Khan Academy content is key to fulfilling this mission.

`KA Lite <http://kalite.learningequality.org/>`__ is a lightweight
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ web app for serving core
Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) from a local server, with
points and progress-tracking, without needing internet connectivity.

Primary use cases include:
--------------------------

-  For servers/\ **computer labs located in remote schools**, which
   could be slowly syncing with a central server over a cell/satellite
   network or via USB keys.
-  In **correctional facilities** and other environments where providing
   educational materials is of value, but users cannot be given general
   internet access.
-  **Mobile school "vans"**, which transport a server and multiple
   laptops/tablets between a number of schools (or orphanages, community
   centers, etc) in remote communities on a rotating basis, and syncing
   up with a central database (to download new content and upload
   analytics) when in an area with internet connectivity.

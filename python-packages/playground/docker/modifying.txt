# in one tab, run the following, which drops you into a transient instance
docker run -i -t ka-lite-installed /bin/bash

# make your changes in there, through the interactive shell.

# When you want to save it, open another linux shell outside the docker instance.
# Run
docker ps
# (or, within the docker, check the hostname)
# to see the processes that are running -- identify yours, and copy its process ID

# overwrite the "ka-lite-installed" image with the current state of your process
# (you should NOT have the server running inside the image when you do this, or the pid will persist)

This crazyness will die in 0.14


However, until then, we will continue to magically import settings to avoid too
much refactoring.

It has been necessary to change this file to not resolve modules by some
perceived file path relative to calling module's __file__, but because we
are installing in a system python environment, Python will resolve the
module imports for us.

# Django is NOT used but is actually bundled, we just put this requirement
# because later versions of django include a utf-8 named file that breaks
# on certain systems when packaging.
# This file:
# https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/tests/staticfiles_tests/apps/test/static/test/%E2%8A%97.txt
# ...to explain: Some of the below packages depend on django, if we don't
# specify a version here, we'll get the latest.

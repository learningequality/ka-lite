[Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/)'s core mission is to "provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere", and as [70% of the world's population is without access to the internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage), primarily in the developing world, providing an alternative delivery mechanism for Khan Academy content is key to fulfilling this mission.

[KA Lite](http://kalite.learningequality.org/) is a lightweight [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web app for serving core Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) from a local server, with points and progress-tracking, without needing internet connectivity. 

#### Primary use cases include:
* For servers/**computer labs located in remote schools**, which could be slowly syncing with a central server over a cell/satellite network or via USB keys.
* In **correctional facilities** and other environments where providing educational materials is of value, but users cannot be given general internet access.
* **Mobile school "vans"**, which transport a server and multiple laptops/tablets between a number of schools (or orphanages, community centers, etc) in remote communities on a rotating basis, and syncing up with a central database (to download new content and upload analytics) when in an area with internet connectivity.

#### We would love for you to get involved!

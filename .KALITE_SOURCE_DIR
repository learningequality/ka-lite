This file is indicating the presence of a source directory as it will NEVER be distributed.

When it is detected in kalite.settings (or some other future settings module), data such as
the SQLite database file, media files, and video contents will be set to point directly at
the path of the source directory, rather than user ~/.kalite dir.

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to KA Lite's documentation!
===================================

I just want to give an example here of how documentation can be organized. Be sure to check out the source and the `rst primer`_ and `toctree directive`_!

.. _rst primer: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html
.. _toctree directive: http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/toctree.html

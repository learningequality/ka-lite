Check out the ss_examples.rst file for some examples. The idea is to have a directive for specifying screenshots of the ka-lite web app that can be automagically updated in the case of UI changes or for building docs in different languages.

A screenshot directive has a number of required options
* `:user-role:` which can be one of `guest`, `learner`, `coach`, or `admin`, and determines what kind of user is logged in for the screenshot.
* `:url:` which is the relative URL to take the screenshot at (or start a sequence of navigation actions to get to the page to take the screenshot at). Don't use urls with UUIDs, as those are dependent on the database and we can't guarantee what will be in the database for screenshot purposes.
* `:navigation-steps:` which is a sequence of steps that needs to be taken. This option is required but it should be OK to leave it blank if no actions need to be taken. Here's the comments about specifying nav steps from the screenshot.py file:
```
    """ Here's how to specify the navigation steps:

        1. selector action [options] ["|" selector action [options]] ...
        2. aliased_action_sequence [options]

        An explanation of navigation steps follows. Some examples can be found
        in ss_examples.rst in this directory.

        Selector is a single css selector (no whitespace allowed).
            "NEXT", which just sends a tab keystroke
            "SAME", which just stays focused on the element from the last action
        Where action could be one of "click", "send_keys", or "submit":
            click has no options and just clicks the element
            send_keys sends a sequence of keystrokes specified as a string by options
                
            submit submits a form and has no options
        Multiple actions on a page can be specified by putting a | separator,
            and specifying the action using the same syntax.

        aliased_action_sequence is one of a reserved keyword which aliases a common
            sequence of actions as above (or performs special actions unavailable by
            the regular syntax) potentially with options. Available aliases:

            LOGIN username password [submit], which just navigates to the login page
                and inputs the given username and password. Submits the form is submit
                is present, otherwise not.
```
If you find yourself writing the same sequence of nav steps over and over again, possibly with minor variations, then we can write an alias for it as for LOGIN.
* `:focus:` which will highlight an element specified by jQuery-style selector (by giving it a nice red border) and optionally add a floating annotation box. Works like this:
    :focus: the_selector | A nice little message that follows.
Just use arbitrary selection a la jQuery (so put a hash in front of IDs, etc). Whitespace can be included, e.g. `li a.classname`. Use the separator for annotations!

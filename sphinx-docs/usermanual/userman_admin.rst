Admininistrator User Manual
============================
**Who is an "administrator"?**

A person who :
    * helps to plan and oversee a project using KA Lite
    * installs and updates KA Lite
    * can create coach logins, Learner logins, download videos and language packs

Administrator Glossary
-------------------------------------------
For users that choose to register online, there are some important terms to familiarize yourself with so that you understand how the flow of data works between installations and the online data hub.

**Sharing Network**
	A sharing network is a group of devices that share data between one another. Data can mean video content, access software applications, and certain files.

**Organization**
	An organization is a group of people responsible for administering a set of Sharing Networks. An organization can have multiple administrators and manage multiple sharing networks.

**Facility**
	A facility is the physical space in which a device is located (e.g. a school or a computer lab in a community center). Learner, coach, and admin accounts are associated with a particular facility.

**Device**
	A device should be able to run a KA Lite server (most computers) and other devices to be used as clients. One common configuration is using a Raspberry Pi or other inexpensive computer as a server and relatively cheap tablets as client devices. Tablets can access the servers through an access point, such as a Wi-Fi dongle, or some other networking device such as a router.

**Web Browser**
    A program that retrieves and presents information resources on the World Wide Web. Popular web browsers include Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.

**Torrent**
    A file or files sent using the BitTorrent protocol. It can be any type of file, such as a movie, song, game, or application. During the transmission, the file is incomplete and therefore referred to as a torrent. Torrent downloads that are incomplete cannot be opened as regular files, because they do not have all the necessary data.

**Seeder**
    Seeders are users who have a complete version of the file you wish to download. If there are no seeders for a particular file, you will not be able to download the file. Seeders are extremely important, for they help distribute the file.

**Bandwidth**
    The amount of data that an Internet connection can handle in a given time. An Internet connection with larger bandwidth can move a certain amount of data much faster than an Internet connection with a lower bandwidth.

Running the KA Lite Server
---------------------------
After a successful installation of KA Lite, the terminal should give you a command to copy. It will look something like the following:

    ``/PATH/TO/KALITE/bin/kalite start``

The first string will vary depending on which folder you installed KA Lite in. Simply copy and paste the provided string back into the command prompt, and hit enter on your keyboard. You will be asked whether or not you wish to run the KA Lite server in the background automatically every time you start up the computer. Once you answer yes or no, success! The KA Lite server is now running on your computer. 

During the process, your operating system might prompt you to allow "Python.app" to accept incoming connections. The message dialogue may look like the following, depending on your operating system:

.. image:: acceptconnections.png
    :align: center

Please allow the app to run. This will make it possible for the KA Lite application to be accessible.

Accessing KA Lite
-------------------
Once the server has been started, you will be given a few IP addresses. You can use these addresses to access KA Lite by copying and pasting them into a web browser of your choice. 

In order to access KA Lite from another machine, please enter the IP address that does *not* start with http://127.0.0.1:8008 into the web browser on that machine.


Setting up KA Lite
-------------------
Once you have successfully installed KA Lite, the installation script should give you a URL (http://127.0.0.1:8008/) to visit so that you can open KA Lite and login for the first time. 

Copy and paste the URL into a web browser. The KA Lite application should show up. Then, login to KA Lite using the username and password you created during the installation process.

.. screenshot::
    :navigation-steps: LOGIN admin superpassword
    :focus: #id_username | Enter your username and password using this form!
    :class: screenshot

* If you have forgotten the username/password combination, simply run ``bin/kalite manage createsuperuser`` from the kalite directory and then follow the instructions. If it is critical that you are able to login with your credentials, :doc:`../contact` and we can help you manually reset your login information.

Once you’ve logged in, the next step in the setup process is registering your device with the KA Lite Hub.

Registering Your Device with the Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By registering your device with FLE, you can sync data back with our central data hub. This is useful for many reasons:

    #. a project administrator can manage user accounts and view usage data from afar, without needing to physically visit the offline device.
    #. usage data syncing back can inform the FLE team of multiple users in a certain geographic region, and we can connect people that might be able to help one another
    #. it helps FLE and our partners understand where and how the software is being used, so we can keep adding features that support you! 

You will have two options: 

    #. **One click registration**. This is the perfect option for individual users who just want to get KA Lite up and running fast, and don't need online access to data. This allows you to get the registration process over in one-click without worrying about creating a login that you're never going to use. **Caution**: if you choose to one-click register, you will unable to register with online access to data later. (If you chose this option by accident and would like to start over, you can rerun the setup command by navigating to the folder KA Lite is in and rerunning the setup command). |first| |one-click|

    #. **Register with online access to data**. Choose this option if you're an administrator of larger projects. This option allows you to access your uploaded data and connect multiple installations to the same account. |long-register|

Post Registration Setup
-------------------------------------------
Now that you have registered successfully, it's time to configure your local KA Lite installation to suit your needs. If any terms like 'facility' or 'device' become confusing, feel free to reference the `Administrator Glossary`_ for a quick reminder.

Create a Facility
-------------------------
KA Lite assumes that you are going to be using the software primarily in one place. This could be a school, a home, a community center, etc. We call this place a “facility”, and use it to help differentiate users who are syncing back data with our central data hub. In order to create a facility, follow the steps below.

1. Log in to KA Lite.
2. Click the "Manage" tab at the top of the page.

.. |bluepencil| image:: bluepencil.png

Allowing Other Users to Connect
--------------------------------
In order for other users to be able to connect to the KA Lite server with a different machine, you will need to give them an IP address with which to access the software. This should be different from the IP address given to you during setup (127.0.0.1:8008). 


Downloading Videos
---------------------
Now that you've created a facility and user accounts, it's time to add video content to your local KA Lite installation! Since the videos can take up a large amount of space, you can choose to download only the videos that you need. If your device has enough space and you wish to download all of the videos, we recommend skipping to `Downloading Videos in Bulk`_ . 


Downloading Individual Videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After registering your device:
1. Click the "Manage" tab at the top of the page.
2. Click on the "Videos" tab.

.. screenshot::
    :user-role: admin
    :url: /management/zone/
    :navigation-steps:
    :focus: li.video
    :class: screenshot

3. View subtopics by clicking on the '+' symbol to the left of a subject of your choice. You can close them by clicking on the '-' symbol.
4. Mark the content you wish to download by clicking the checkbox to the left of the content name. 
5. Click the green "Download" button in the top left box of the page. The button should also show you the total number of videos you have selected to download, as well as the total size of the content.
6. Once the download is completed, video content will be ready for Learners to watch!

Downloading Videos in Bulk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to download videos in bulk, your best option is to download the KA Lite videos through the `BitTorrent Sync`_ client. This will be a much faster process than using the KA Lite app to download all of the videos.

We have made the full set of KA videos (in the format needed by KA Lite) available via `BitTorrent Sync`_ (btsync). Note that this is different from BitTorrent; btsync allows us to add new videos or fix problems without issuing a whole new torrent file, and then having seeders split between the old and new torrent files. Here are the steps to set this up:

#. Download and install `BitTorrent Sync`_.
#. Run btsync. On some platforms, this will bring up a graphical interface. On Linux, you will need to type http://127.0.0.1:8888/ into the address bar of your browser to get the interface.
#. Click the "Enter a key or link" button, and put in **https://link.getsync.com/#f=ka-lite-compressed&sz=25E9&q=-&s=TOQVB3LLGWCKEQ6NOCFBSEVWA74PRA6I&q=-&i=C4M3QMAVXE7RVXR7B3526TBD5V3KYV5V6&q=-&p=CCGAGLIJGFQFP2X2Z4QWQ3MLPJHTVV3A**
#. Select the "content" folder inside your KA Lite installation as the "location" (unless you want the videos to be located elsewhere).
#. Allow the videos to sync in there from your peers! It may take a while for now, as we don't yet have many seeders on it. On that note -- please help seed by keeping it running even after you've got all the videos, if you have bandwidth to spare! This will make it easier for others to download the content as well.

These are resized videos. All in all, this will take around 23 GB of space. 

 
.. WARNING:: 
    If you chose to download them to somewhere other than the content folder inside the ka-lite folder as recommended above, you need to tell KA Lite where to find them. If this is the case, follow the steps below:


#. Make sure all video files are located in a single directory, with .mp4 extensions (KA Lite expects this!)
#. If it doesn't already exist, create a file named local_settings.py in the ka-lite/kalite folder (the one containing settings.py)
#. Add the line ``CONTENT_ROOT="[full path to your videos directory]"``, making SURE to include an OS-specific slash at the end (see examples) and encapsulate it in quotes. 
    **For example, on Windows:** ``CONTENT_ROOT="C:\\torrented_videos_location\\"``

    **For example, on Linux:** ``CONTENT_ROOT="/home/me/torrented_videos_location/"``
#. Restart your server. If you are unsure on how to do this, please see `Restarting Your Server`_ .

Language Packs
---------------------------
KA Lite supports internationalization. You can download language packs for your language if it is available. A language pack comes with all the available subtitles and user interface translations for that language. When it is installed, KA Lite will give you the option to download individual dubbed videos from the language's Khan Academy YouTube channel.

Download Language Packs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To download language packs: 

1. From the "Manage" page, click on the "Language" tab.

.. |language-tab-highlight| screenshot::

Restarting Your Server
-----------------------
If you have made some configuration changes (such as changing the filepath to your video content to your liking), or if you feel the need to reboot your KA Lite system, you may want to restart your server. Please note that this will cause KA Lite to become inaccessible to any users. However, this will not delete any user accounts or information that you have configured during set up. 

This process varies, depending on which OS you are running the KA Lite Server on. 

Restarting Your Server: Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the system tray, right click on the KA Lite icon. Click the "Stop Server" item in the context menu. Right click on the KA Lite icon in the system tray again, and click "Start Server". If the option is not clickable, wait a while and try again or restart your computer.


Restarting Your Server: Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Open up your terminal. For most Linux distributions, you can do this by going to **Menu -> Accessories -> Terminal** or **Applications menu -> System -> Terminal.**

#. Navigate to the folder that you downloaded KA Lite in. You can do this by typing ``cd <PATH/TO/KALITE/FOLDER>``. Change the path to the path name of the KA Lite folder on your machine. 

#. Type in ``bin/kalite restart``. This should stop the server, then attempt to restart it again. The process may take up to a few minutes. 

#. Once you see the script that begins with ``To access KA Lite from another connected computer, try the following address(es):`` .... you will know that your KA Lite server has been successfully restarted.

Restarting Your Server: Mac 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#. Open up your terminal. You may do this by navigating to the magnifying glass |magglass| at the top right corner of your screen, and typing in "Terminal", then hitting "Enter" on your keyboard.

.. |magglass| image:: magglass.png

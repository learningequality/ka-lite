Sometimes the signal is being sent a long distance, for example from the brain down to the bones in the toe, and other times the signal is being sent to cells that are just a few millimeters away.

Charlemagne and the Ottonians had partially and briefly unified the West, and of course the Church was a stabilizing institution, but it was only in the 11th Century that everything changed. Now there was finally enough peace and prosperity to allow for travel and for the widespread construction of large buildings. These were, with rare exceptions, the first large structures to be built in the West since the fall of the Romans so many centuries before. We call the period Romanesque (Roman-like) because the masons of this period looked back to the architecture of ancient Rome.

Most altarpieces in the Renaissance were made of many interconnected panels that were later sold and ended up in different collections, and this means that to see one altarpiece you usually have to travel to many museums. But this is not true of the St. Wolfgang altarpiece. Seeing a Renaissance work of art in the space it was made for helps us to travel back in time to the late 15th Century.",

In essence, modern mass culture was born. Artists responded sometimes by embracing these radical changes, and at other times by resisting them. Key here is understanding the authority of the various art academies in Europe, which controlled matters related to taste and art, and which were, to some extent, always connected to the government. A small number of artists rebelled against the strictures of the academy, and against the demand for art to tell clear stories for a middle class audience, and formed what we know as the \u201cavant-garde.\u201d",

These had mixed results, to say the least. John will cover all this and more in this week's Crash Course World History.\n", "id": "a1AhZoWTLUI", "slug": "crash-course-world-history-37", "title": "Communists, Nationalists, and China's Revolutions"}, {"slug": "crash-course-world-history-38", "title": "World War II", "id": "dllD-6loBK4", "kind": "Video", "description": "In which John Green teaches you about World War II, aka The Great Patriotic War, aka The Big One. So how did this war happen? And what does it mean? We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences. So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war. Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves. Oh, and a warning: there are a few graphic images in this episode. Sensitive viewers may want to use caution, especially around the 9:15 mark."}, {"slug": "crash-course-world-history-39", "title": "USA vs USSR Fight!

In the sense of its temperature. It was by no means cool, man. After World War II, there were basically two big geopolitical powers left to divide up the world. And divide they did. The United States and the Soviet Union divvied up Europe in the aftermath of the war, and then proceeded to spend the next 45 years fighting over the rest of the world. It was the great ideological struggle, with the US on the side of capitalism and profit, and the USSR pushing Communism, so-called. While both sides presented themselves as the good guy in this situation, the reality is that there are no good guys. Both parties to the Cold War engaged in forcible regime changes, built up vast nuclear arsenals, and basically got up to dirty tricks. If you had to pick a bad guy though, I would point out that the USSR had no intention of bringing Laika the Cosmonaut Dog home alive. That poor dog never had a shot."}, {"kind": "Video", "description": "In which John Green teaches you about the post-World War II breakup of most of the European empires. As you'll remember from previous installments of Crash Course, Europeans spent several centuries sailing around the world creating empires, despite the fact that most of the places they conquered were perfectly happy to carry on alone. After World War II, most of these empires collapsed. This is the story of those collapses. In most places, the end of empire was not orderly, and violence often ensued. While India was a (sort of) shining example of non-violent change, in places like The Congo, Egypt, Rwanda, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, things didn't go smoothly at all.

(Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it.

At the same time he arranged for the restoration of these temples, and organized the return to their homelands of a number of people who had been held in Babylonia by the Babylonian kings. Although the Jews are not mentioned in this document, their return to Palestine following their deportation by Nebuchadnezzar II, was part of this policy.\n\nThe cylinder is often referred to as the first bill of human rights as it appears to encourage freedom of worship throughout the Persian Empire and to allow deported people to return to their homelands, but it in fact reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium B.C.E., kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.\u00a0\n\nIt was found in Babylon in modern Iraq in 1879 during a British Museum excavation.\n"}, {"slug": "bull-capital-susa", "title": "Capital of a column from the audience hall of the palace of Darius I, Susa", "id": "mjxCTApdX3Q", "kind": "Video", "description": "Capital of a column from the audience hall of the palace of Darius I, Susa, c. 510 B.C.E., \u00a0Achaemenid, \u00a0Tell of the Apadana, Susa, Iran (Louvre)\nSpeakers: Dr. Steven Zucker & Dr. Beth Harris"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "ancient-art-civilizations", "ancient-near-east1"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Exercise"], "hide": false, "description": "", "x_pos": 0, "node_slug": "quiz-ancient-near-eastern-art", "title": "Quiz: Ancient Near Eastern art", "child_data": [{"kind": "Exercise", "id": "x909abe64"}], "render_type": "Tutorial", "slug": "quiz-ancient-near-eastern-art", "parent_id": "ancient-near-east1", "path": "khan/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/ancient-near-east1/quiz-ancient-near-eastern-art/", "id": "quiz-ancient-near-eastern-art", "topic_page_url": "/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/ancient-near-east1/quiz-ancient-near-eastern-art", "extended_slug": "humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/ancient-near-east1/quiz-ancient-near-eastern-art", "in_knowledge_map": false, "children": [{"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge!", "id": "ancient-near-eastern-art", "slug": "ancient-near-eastern-art", "title": "Ancient Near Eastern art (quiz)"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "ancient-art-civilizations", "egypt-art"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Video", "Exercise"], "hide": false, "description": "While today we consider the Greco-Roman period to be in the distant past, it should be noted that Cleopatra VII's reign (which ended in 30 B.C.E.) is closer to our own time than it was to that of the construction of the pyramids of Giza.

The simplest is the Tuscan, supposedly derived from the Etruscan-type temple. It has a base and capital and a plain column. The Doric is probably earlier, however, its Greek version having no base, as on the Parthenon. The Ionic Order, with its twin volute capitals, originated in Asia Minor in the mid-6th century B.C.E. The Corinthian Order was an Athenian invention of the 5th century B.C.E. and was later developed by the Romans.

Siena had a unique style that emphasized decorative surfaces, sinuous lines, elongated figures and the heavy use of gold.\n\nDuccio was the founder of the Sienese style and his work was quite different from the Florentine painter Giotto. Giotto emphasized a greater naturalism\u2014creating figures who are more monumental (large, heavy and with a greater sense of accurate proportion) and a greater illusion of three-dimensional space.\u00a0\n\nContemporaneous description of the procession that brought this painting to Siena Cathedral (or Duomo):\n\nAt this time the altarpiece for the high altar was finished and the picture which was called the \"Madonna with the large eyes\" or Our Lady of Grace, that now hangs over the altar of St. Boniface, was taken down. Now this Our Lady was she who had hearkened to the people of Siena when the Florentines were routed at Monte Aperto, and her place was changed because the new one was made, which is far more beautiful and devout and larger, and is painted on the back with the stories of the Old and New Testaments. And on the day that it was carried to the Duomo the shops were shut, and the bishop conducted a great and devout company of priests and friars in solemn procession, accompanied by the nine signiors, and all the officers of the commune, and all the people, and one after another the worthiest with lighted candles in their hands took places near the picture, and behind came the women and children with great devotion. And they accompanied the said picture up to the Duomo, making the procession around the Campo, as is the custom, all the bells ringing joyously, out of reverence for so noble a picture as this. And this picture Duccio di Niccol\u00f2 the painter made, and it was made in the house of the Muciatti outside the gate aStalloreggi. And all that day persons, praying God and His Mother, who is our advocate, to defend us by their infinite mercy from every adversity and all evil, and keep us from the hands of traitors and of the enemies of Siena.\n\nEnglish translation: Charles Eliot Norton,\u00a0Historical Studies of Church-Buildings in the Middle Ages: Venice, Siena, Florence\u00a0(New York: Harper & Brothers, 1880), 144-45\n\nItalian text:\u00a0G.

The legend also states that she took with her 11,000 virgin companions as company for the journey.\n\nThe troop of 11,000 virgins travelled to Cologne, Basle and Rome and made their way home back through Cologne. It was here that they met with a group of pagan Huns, whose leader wanted to marry Ursula. Ursula being already engaged and a virgin refused! This made the Huns so angry that they murdered all 11,000 of the girls by arrow fire.\n\n11,000 virgins is certainly a large party \u2013 the legend of there being 11,000 virgins became fixed in the 10th century, but this was probably through a misunderstanding of a Latin numerical inscription which read 11 rather than 11,000!

(and he showed her the woods\u2019 shade). But if you are afraid to enter the wild beasts\u2019 lairs, you can go into the remote woods in safety, protected by a god, and not by any lesser god, but by the one who holds the sceptre of heaven in his mighty hand, and who hurls the flickering bolts of lightning. Do not fly from me!\u2019 She was already in flight. She had left behind Lerna\u2019s pastures, and the Lyrcean plain\u2019s wooded fields, when the god hid the wide earth in a covering of fog, caught the fleeing girl, and raped her.\u00a0\n\nUniversity of Virginia etext, translation from the Latin by Anthony S.

Today, we call this \"Roman Catholic\" because there are so many other types of churches (ie Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Calvinist, Anglican - you get the idea).", "x_pos": 0, "node_slug": "protestant-reformation1", "title": "The Protestant Reformation", "child_data": [{"kind": "Article", "id": "xf26aa3cd"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xb1a832b2"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x20184df0"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xf4983822"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x66fe4fa1"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x892579e3"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "id": "x7829049c"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "id": "xcd5a925c"}], "render_type": "Tutorial", "slug": "protestant-reformation1", "parent_id": "renaissance-reformation", "path": "khan/humanities/renaissance-reformation/protestant-reformation1/", "id": "protestant-reformation1", "topic_page_url": "/humanities/renaissance-reformation/protestant-reformation1", "extended_slug": "humanities/renaissance-reformation/protestant-reformation1", "in_knowledge_map": false, "children": [{"kind": "Video", "description": "Speakers: Dr. Steven Zucker & Dr. Beth Harris", "id": "qTGJMnTWrrw", "slug": "protestant-reformation-1", "title": "Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: Setting the stage (part 1)"}, {"slug": "introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation-luther-2-of-4", "title": "Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther (part 2)", "id": "dSOnLt3YVl0", "kind": "Video", "description": "An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: Martin Luther (2 of 4)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Steven Zucker & Dr. Beth Harris"}, {"kind": "Video", "description": "An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: Varieties of Protestantism (3 of 4)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Steven Zucker & Dr. Beth Harris", "id": "F6ZsIyKHTNI", "slug": "introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation-3-of-4", "title": "Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: Varieties of Protestantism (part 3)"}, {"slug": "introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation-the-counter-reformation-4-of-4", "title": "Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: The Counter-Reformation (part 4)", "id": "C6PUlTYnxLY", "kind": "Video", "description": "Introduction to the Protestant Reformation: \nThe Counter-Reformation (4 of 4)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris & Dr. Steven Zucker"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge.", "id": "cranach-s-law-and-gospel-quiz", "slug": "cranach-s-law-and-gospel-quiz", "title": "Cranach's Law and Gospel (quiz)"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge!", "id": "protestant-reformation", "slug": "protestant-reformation", "title": "Protestant Reformation"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "monarchy-enlightenment", "baroque-art1"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Exercise"], "hide": false, "description": "Get a head start on the historical developments that shape Baroque art in the Catholic Italy, Spain, Flanders, France and in the Protestant north.", "x_pos": 0, "node_slug": "beginners-guide-baroque1", "title": "A beginner's guide to Baroque art", "child_data": [{"kind": "Article", "id": "xf2306eba"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x12499209"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "id": "x125cf259"}], "render_type": "Tutorial", "slug": "beginners-guide-baroque1", "parent_id": "baroque-art1", "path": "khan/humanities/monarchy-enlightenment/baroque-art1/beginners-guide-baroque1/", "id": "beginners-guide-baroque1", "topic_page_url": "/humanities/monarchy-enlightenment/baroque-art1/beginners-guide-baroque1", "extended_slug": "humanities/monarchy-enlightenment/baroque-art1/beginners-guide-baroque1", "in_knowledge_map": false, "children": [{"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge!", "id": "a-beginner-s-guide-to-the-baroque", "slug": "a-beginner-s-guide-to-the-baroque", "title": "A beginner's guide to the Baroque (quiz)"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "monarchy-enlightenment", "baroque-art1"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Video", "Exercise"], "hide": false, "description": "This tutorial is about magic.

She was the only one of the Gorgons who was subject to mortality. She is celebrated for her personal charms and the beauty of her locks. Neptune became enamoured of her, and obtained her favours in the temple of Minerva. This violation of the sanctity of the temple provoked Minerva, and she changed the beautiful locks of Medusa, which had inspired Neptune\u2019s love to serpents.\n\nAccording to Apollodorus, Medusa and her sisters came into the world with snakes on their heads, instead of hair, with yellow wings and brazen hands. Their bodies were also covered with impenetrable scales, and their very looks had the power of killing or turning to stones. Perseus rendered his name immortal by his conquest of Medusa. He cut off her head, and the blood that dropped from the wound produced the innumerable serpents that infest Africa. The conqueror placed Medusa's head on the shield of Minerva, which he had used in his expedition. The head still retained the same petrifying power as before, as it was fatally known in the court of Cepheus. . . .

In his hands I saw a great golden spear, and at the iron tip there appeared to be a point of fire. This he plunged into my heart several times so that it penetrated to my entrails. When he pulled it out I felt that he took them with it, and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God. The pain wasso severe that it made me utter several moans. The sweetness caused by this intense pain is so extreme that one cannot possibly wish it to cease, nor is one's soul content with anything but God.

He pays little heed to Venus, his mistress, who, accompanied by Amors and Cupids, strives with caresses and emraces to hold him. From the other side, Mars is dragged forward by the Fury Alekto, with a torch in her hand. Near by are monsters personifying Pestilence and Famine, those inseparable partners of War. On the ground, turning her back, lies a woman with a broken lute, representing Harmony, which is incompatible with the discord of War. There is also a mother with her child in her arms, indicating that fecundity, procreation and charity are thwarted by War, which corrupts and destroys everything. In addition, one sees an architect thrown on his back, with his instruments in his hand, to show that which in time of peace is constructed for the use and ornamentation of the City, is hurled to the ground by the force of arms and falls to ruin. I believe, if I remember rightly, that you will find on the ground, under the feet of Mars, a book and a drawing on paper, to imply that he treads underfoot all the arts and letters. There ought also to be a bundle of darts or arrows, with the band which held them together undone; these when bound form the symbol of Concord. Beside them is the caduceus and an olive branch, attribute of Peace; these are also cast aside. That grief-stricken woman clothed in black, with torn veil, robbed of all her jewles and other ornaments, is the unfortunate Europe who, for so many years now, has suffered plunder, outrage, and misery, which are so injurious to everyone, that it is unnecessary to go into detail. Europe's attribute is the globe, borne by a small angel or genius, and surmounted by the cross, to symbolize the Christian world.

In this painting, which measures more than 17 feet high and 23 feet wide, Gros depicted a legendary episode from Napoleon's campaigns in Egypt (1798-1801). On March 21, 1799, \u00a0in a make-shift hospital in Jaffa, Napoleon visited his troops who were stricken with the Bubonic Plague. Gros depicts Napoleon attempting to calm the growing panic about contagion by fearlessly \u00a0touching the sores of one of the plague victims. Like earlier neoclassical paintings such as David's Death of Marat, Gros combines Christian iconography, in this case Christ healing the sick, with a contemporary subject. He also draws on the art of classical antiquity, by depicting Napoleon in the same position as the ancient Greek sculpture, the Apollo Belvedere. In this way, he imbues Napoleon with divine qualities while simultaneously showing him as a military hero. But in contrast to David, Gros uses warm, sensual colors and focuses on the dead and dying who occupy the foreground of the painting. We see the same approach later in Delacroix's painting ofLiberty Leading the People (1830). Napoleon was a master at using art to manipulate his public image. In reality he had ordered the death of the prisoners who he could not afford to house or feed, and poisoned his troops who were dying from the plague as he retreated from Jaffa.\n"}, {"slug": "ingres-la-grande-odalisque-1814", "title": "Ingres, La Grande Odalisque", "id": "lSV-J1JHDFY", "kind": "Video", "description": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, La Grande Odalisque, 1814, Oil on canvas, 36\" x 63\" (91 x 162 cm), (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris)"}, {"slug": "ingres-princess-de-broglie-1851-53", "title": "Ingres, Princesse de Broglie", "id": "sQpAYcxSVEg", "kind": "Video", "description": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres,\u00a0Princesse de Broglie, oil on canvas,\u00a01851\u201353\u00a0(The Metropolitan Museum of Art).\u00a0Speakers:\u00a0Dr. Beth Harris,\u00a0Dr. Steven Zucker"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge.", "id": "ingres--la-grande-odalisque-quiz", "slug": "ingres-la-grande-odalisque-quiz", "title": "Ingres, La Grande Odalisque (quiz)"}, {"slug": "ingres-raphael-and-the-fornarina-1814", "title": "Ingres, Raphael and the Fornarina", "id": "CXsstWSXh68", "kind": "Video", "description": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Raphael and the Fornarina, 1814, Oil on canvas, 64.77 x 53.34 cm (25 1/2 x 21 in.)

However, he was not interested in mirroring polite parlor conversations and middle class promenades in the Bois de \u00a0Boulogne (Paris\u2019 Central Park). Rather, Manet invented subjects that set the Parisians\u2019 teeth on edge.\u00a0\n\nIn 1865, Manet submitted his risqu\u00e9 painting of a courtesan greeting her client (in this case, you), Olympia, of 1863, to the French Salon. The jury for the 1865 Salon accepted this painting despite their disapproval of the subject matter, because two years earlier, Manet\u2019s Luncheon on the Grass created such a stir when it was rejected from the Salon. (It was instead exhibited in Emperor Napoleon III\u2019s conciliatory exhibition\u2014the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s, or the Exhibition of the Refused. Crowds came to the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s specifically to laugh and jeer at what they considered Manet\u2019s folly.)\n\nSomehow they were afraid another rejection would seem like a personal attack on Manet himself. The reasoning was odd, but the result was the same\u2014Olympia became infamous and the painting had to be hung very high to protect it from physical attacks.\u00a0\n\nManet was a Realist, but sometimes his \u201creal\u201d situations shocked and rocked the Parisian art world to its foundations. His later work was much tamer.\n\n(Text by Dr. Beth Gersh-Nesic)\n"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "description": "This quiz is for the video Manet, Olympia.", "id": "manet-s-olympia-quiz", "slug": "manet-s-olympia-quiz", "title": "Manet's Olympia Quiz"}, {"slug": "manet-le-d-jeuner-sur-l-herbe-luncheon-on-the-grass-1863", "title": "Manet, Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe", "id": "Nb_4nEFyeGk", "kind": "Video", "description": "\u00c9douard Manet, Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (Luncheon on the Grass), oil on canvas, 1863 (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker"}, {"slug": "manet-mile-zola-1868", "title": "Manet, \u00c9mile Zola", "id": "znKX9WcowfY", "kind": "Video", "description": "\u00c9douard Manet, \u00c9mile Zola, 1868, oil on canvas, 57 x 45 inches or 146.5 x 114 cm\n(Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nThis portrait was painted in appreciation for the support Zola gave to Manet in his\n1866 essay in La Revue du XXe si\u00e8cle and during Manet's independent exhibition \nheld along side the Universal Exposition in 1867."}, {"slug": "manet-the-balcony-1868-69", "title": "Manet, The Balcony", "id": "XS8OhYdc-20", "kind": "Video", "description": "\u00c9douard Manet, The Balcony, 1868-69, oil on canvas, 66-1/2 x 44-1/4 inches (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris)\n\nSpeakers: Drs.

Mary Cassatt's remarkable painting In the Loge (c. 1878-79) clearly shows the complex relationship between the gaze, public spectacle, gender, and class privilege.\n\nCassatt was a wealthy American artist who had adopted the style of the Impressionists while living in Paris. Here she depicts a fashionable upper-class woman in a box seat at the Paris opera (as it happens, the sitter is Cassatt's sister, Lydia). Lydia is shown holding opera glasses up to her eyes; but instead of tilting them down, as she would if she were watching the performance below, her gaze is level. She peers straight across the chamber perhaps at another member of the audience. Look closely and you will notice that, in turn, and in one of the boxes across the room, a gentleman is gazing at her. Lydia is then, in a sense, caught between his gaze and ours even as she spies another.\n"}, {"slug": "mary-cassatt-woman-with-a-pearl-necklace-in-a-loge-1879", "title": "Cassatt, Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge", "id": "guxLpVICBjg", "kind": "Video", "description": "Mary Cassatt, Woman with a Pearl Necklace in a Loge, 1879, oil on canvas, 32 x 23-1/2 inches or 81.3 x 59.7 cm (Philadelphia Museum of Art)"}, {"slug": "cassatt-the-loge-1882", "title": "Cassatt, The Loge", "id": "zOZiuAOuOkA", "kind": "Video", "description": "Mary Cassatt, The Loge, oil on canvas, 1882. 31-7/16 x 25-1/8 inches (National Gallery of Art)\n\nSpeakers: Beth Harris and Steven Zucker"}, {"slug": "mary-cassatt-the-child-s-bath-1893", "title": "Cassatt, The Child's Bath", "id": "O4St29B7cmU", "kind": "Video", "description": "Mary Cassatt, The Child's Bath, 1893, oil on canvas, 100.3 x 66.1 cm / 39-1/2 x 26 inches (Art Institute of Chicago)"}, {"slug": "mary-cassatt-breakfast-in-bed-1897", "title": "Cassatt, Breakfast in Bed", "id": "gDbpcwwUgjI", "kind": "Video", "description": "Mary Cassatt, Breakfast In Bed, 1897 (Huntington Library) \n\nSpeakers: Beth Harris and Steven Zucker"}, {"slug": "john-singer-sargent-carnation-lily-lily-rose-1885-86", "title": "Sargent, Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose", "id": "-bnCHws9qmw", "kind": "Video", "description": "John Singer Sargent, Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose, 1885-86, oil on canvas, 1740 x 1537 mm (Tate Britain, London)"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "global-culture"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Video"], "hide": false, "description": "If abstract art puzzles you, this is a great place to start.", "x_pos": 0, "node_slug": "beginners-guide-20-21", "title": "A beginner's guide to 20th and 21st century art", "child_data": [{"kind": "Video", "id": 1020984445}, {"kind": "Video", "id": 1032809887}], "render_type": "Tutorial", "slug": "beginners-guide-20-21", "parent_id": "global-culture", "path": "khan/humanities/global-culture/beginners-guide-20-21/", "id": "beginners-guide-20-21", "topic_page_url": "/humanities/global-culture/beginners-guide-20-21", "extended_slug": "humanities/global-culture/beginners-guide-20-21", "in_knowledge_map": false, "children": [{"slug": "representation-abstraction-looking-at-millais-and-newman", "title": "Representation and abstraction: Millais's Ophelia and Newman's Vir Heroicus Sublimis", "id": "8-5DTsl1V5k", "kind": "Video", "description": "Representation & Abstraction: Looking at Millais and Newman\nJohn Everett Millais, Ophelia, 1851-2 (Tate Britain) and Barnett Newman, Vir Heroicus Sublimus,  1950-51 (MoMA)\n\nA conversation with Sal Khan, Beth Harris & Steven Zucker"}, {"slug": "art-context", "title": "Art and context: Monet's Cliff Walk at Pourville and Malevich's White on White", "id": "2aUFB9hQncQ", "kind": "Video", "description": "Art & Context: Monet's Cliff Walk at Pourville & Malevich's Suprematist Composition: White on White\n\nA conversation with Sal Khan, Steven Zucker & Beth Harris"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "humanities", "global-culture", "early-abstraction"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Video"], "hide": false, "description": "Les Fauves (the wild beasts) used color the way most artists use line, to define form in space.

Some witnesses, already shocked by the things that they saw covering the walls, and that they refused to call paintings because they were made of oilcloth, wrapping paper, and newspaper, said, pointing a haughty finger at the object of Picasso's clever pains: \"What is it?

These structural units may be repeated and combined to form the elevation of a building and its architectural vocabulary.\n\nThere are eight Orders in total: Doric (Greek and Roman versions), Tuscan, Ionic (Greek and Roman), Corinthian (Greek and Roman), and Composite. The simplest is the Tuscan, supposedly derived from the Etruscan-type temple. It has a base and capital and a plain column. The Doric is probably earlier, however, its Greek version having no base, as on the Parthenon. The Ionic Order, with its twin volute capitals, originated in Asia Minor in the mid-6th century B.C.E. The Corinthian Order was an Athenian invention of the 5th century B.C.E. and was later developed by the Romans. The Composite Order is a late Roman combination of elements from the Ionic and Corinthian Orders.\n\nThe Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms, Michael Clarke, Deborah Clarke. \u00a9 2012 Oxford University Press.

In his hands I saw a great golden spear, and at the iron tip there appeared to be a point of fire. This he plunged into my heart several times so that it penetrated to my entrails. When he pulled it out I felt that he took them with it, and left me utterly consumed by the great love of God. The pain wasso severe that it made me utter several moans. The sweetness caused by this intense pain is so extreme that one cannot possibly wish it to cease, nor is one's soul content with anything but God.

However, he was not interested in mirroring polite parlor conversations and middle class promenades in the Bois de \u00a0Boulogne (Paris\u2019 Central Park). Rather, Manet invented subjects that set the Parisians\u2019 teeth on edge.\u00a0\n\nIn 1865, Manet submitted his risqu\u00e9 painting of a courtesan greeting her client (in this case, you), Olympia, of 1863, to the French Salon. The jury for the 1865 Salon accepted this painting despite their disapproval of the subject matter, because two years earlier, Manet\u2019s Luncheon on the Grass created such a stir when it was rejected from the Salon. (It was instead exhibited in Emperor Napoleon III\u2019s conciliatory exhibition\u2014the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s, or the Exhibition of the Refused. Crowds came to the Salon des R\u00e9fus\u00e9s specifically to laugh and jeer at what they considered Manet\u2019s folly.)\n\nSomehow they were afraid another rejection would seem like a personal attack on Manet himself. The reasoning was odd, but the result was the same\u2014Olympia became infamous and the painting had to be hung very high to protect it from physical attacks.\u00a0\n\nManet was a Realist, but sometimes his \u201creal\u201d situations shocked and rocked the Parisian art world to its foundations. His later work was much tamer.\n\n(Text by Dr. Beth Gersh-Nesic)\n"}, {"slug": "claude-monet-gare-st-lazare-1877", "title": "Monet, Gare St. Lazare", "id": "sYQ5CSyACpc", "kind": "Video", "description": "Claude Monet, Gare St. Lazare, 1877 (Musee d'Orsay)"}, {"slug": "gustav-klimt-the-kiss-1907-8", "title": "Gustav Klimt, The Kiss", "id": "BRUOACBkFRg", "kind": "Video", "description": "Gustav Klimt, The Kiss, 1907-8, oil and gold leaf on canvas, 180 x 180 cm (\u00d6sterreichische Galerie Belvedere, Vienna)"}, {"slug": "picasso-les-demoiselles-d-avignon-1907", "title": "Picasso, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon", "id": "fy2TlYnYIzA", "kind": "Video", "description": "Pablo Picasso, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, 1907 (Museum of Modern Art)"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge.", "id": "braque-s-the-portuguese-quiz", "slug": "braque-s-the-portuguese-quiz", "title": "Braque's The Portuguese (quiz)"}, {"slug": "marcel-duchamp-fountain-1917", "title": "Duchamp, Fountain", "id": "FmjSUyyc-3M", "kind": "Video", "description": "A conversation between Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker in front of: Marcel Duchamp, Fountain, 1917/1964, porcelain urinal, paint, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\n"}, {"kind": "Exercise", "description": "Test your knowledge!", "id": "oppenheim-s-object-quiz", "slug": "oppenheim-s-object-quiz", "title": "Oppenheim's Object Quiz"}, {"slug": "willem-de-kooning-woman-i-1950-52", "title": "de Kooning's Woman I", "id": "WEYKoJTIHcE", "kind": "Video", "description": "Willem de Kooning, Woman I, oil on canvas, 1950-52 (MoMA)\n\nSpeakers: Dr. Beth Harris, Dr. Steven Zucker"}, {"slug": "mies-van-der-rohe-seagram-building-new-york-city-1958", "title": "Mies van der Rohe, Seagram Building", "id": "ZyyuflY5k2k", "kind": "Video", "description": "Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Seagram Building, 375 Park Avenue, New York City (1958) Speakers: Dr. Matthew Postal, Dr. Steven Zucker.

The reconstruction of his grave illustrates the early Egyptian custom of placing the body in a contracted, foetal position, usually on the left side, with the head to the south, facing the west, the land of the dead where he would be reborn. Around him were all the things he might need for his afterlife, especially pottery to hold and serve food.\nBefore the pharaohs\n\nIn the Predynastic period (4400-3100 B.C.E.), the time before the pharaohs, the dead were buried in shallow graves cut into the desert sand. The graves were often lined with reed mats, making them like a bed, and the body was covered with linen or skins and more mats, like a blanket, before the grave was refilled and perhaps topped by a mound of dirt. Contact with the hot dry sand naturally preserved the bodies because the sand absorbed the water that constitutes approximately 75% by weight of the human body. Bacteria cannot breed without moisture and as a result, the bodies frequently did not decay, but simply dried out. The body of this man is remarkably well-preserved, even down to his finger-nails and hair, which has probably faded with time.\n\nChance discoveries of these sand-dried mummies (for example, when a grave was disturbed by animals or robbers), may have promoted the belief that physical preservation of the body was necessary for the afterlife. This may have led the later Egyptians to develop means of artificial mummification after the introduction of coffins and deeper graves separated the body from the natural drying effects of the sand.\n\nThe objects that surrounded Gebelein Man in his original burial are unknown. On display\u00a0is a selection of typical grave-goods from other graves of the middle Predynastic period (about 3500 B.C.E.), the time we believe he died. Attempts to date the body using Carbon 14 (the radiocarbon method) have so far been unsuccessful.\nHe has been in the British Museum collection for over 100 years, but it was not until 2012 that he was CT scanned for the first time. Detailed images created from the CT scans' high resolution X-rays are allowing us to look inside his body and learn about his life and his death in ways never before possible. \u00a9 Trustees of the British Museum"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "partner-content", "british-museum", "africa1"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Video"], "hide": false, "description": "Ife is today regarded as the spiritual heartland of the Yoruba people living in Nigeria, the Republic of Benin and their many descendants around the world.

He then describes measures of relief he brought to the inhabitants of the city, and tells how he returned a number of images of gods, which Nabonidus had collected in Babylon, to their proper temples throughout Mesopotamia and western Iran. At the same time he arranged for the restoration of these temples, and organized the return to their homelands of a number of people who had been held in Babylonia by the Babylonian kings. Although the Jews are not mentioned in this document, their return to Palestine following their deportation by Nebuchadnezzar II, was part of this policy.\n\nThe cylinder is often referred to as the first bill of human rights as it appears to encourage freedom of worship throughout the Persian Empire and to allow deported people to return to their homelands, but it in fact reflects a long tradition in Mesopotamia where, from as early as the third millennium B.C.E., kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms.\u00a0\n\nIt was found in Babylon in modern Iraq in 1879 during a British Museum excavation.\n"}], "y_pos": 0}, {"icon_src": "", "ancestor_ids": ["root", "partner-content", "british-museum", "middle-east-bm"], "kind": "Topic", "contains": ["Video"], "hide": false, "description": "The term Islamic is used here to define the art and material culture of those lands where the dominant religion is Islam, the religion revealed to the prophet Muhammad in seventh century Arabia.", "x_pos": 0, "node_slug": "islamic-middle-east", "title": "Islamic Middle East", "child_data": [{"kind": "Article", "id": "x0b7c16da"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "x02c1e2ab"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "xaf6ef088"}, {"kind": "Article", "id": "xbf6524bd"}, {"kind": "Video", "id": "x3e0e86eb"}], "render_type": "Tutorial", "slug": "islamic-middle-east", "parent_id": "middle-east-bm", "path": "khan/partner-content/british-museum/middle-east-bm/islamic-middle-east/", "id": "islamic-middle-east", "topic_page_url": "/partner-content/british-museum/middle-east-bm/islamic-middle-east", "extended_slug": "partner-content/british-museum/middle-east-bm/islamic-middle-east", "in_knowledge_map": false, "children": [{"slug": "modern-pilgrimage-stories", "title": "Stories of the modern pilgrimage", "id": "r5l5Cwge7yk", "kind": "Video", "description": "Every year, 25,000 British Muslims make the pilgrimage to Mecca.

About KA Lite
-------------

`Khan Academy <http://www.khanacademy.org/>`__'s core mission is to
"provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere", and as over `60%
of the world's population is without access to the
internet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage>`__,
primarily in the developing world, providing an alternative delivery
mechanism for Khan Academy content is key to fulfilling this mission.

`KA Lite <http://kalite.learningequality.org/>`__ is a lightweight
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ web app for serving core
Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) from a local server, with
points and progress-tracking, without needing internet connectivity.

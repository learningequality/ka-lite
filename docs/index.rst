About KA Lite
-------------

`Khan Academy <http://www.khanacademy.org/>`__'s core mission is to
"provide a free world-class education for anyone anywhere", and as over `60%
of the world's population is without access to the
internet <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage>`__,
primarily in the developing world, providing an alternative delivery
mechanism for Khan Academy content is key to fulfilling this mission.

`KA Lite <http://kalite.learningequality.org/>`__ is a lightweight
`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ web app for serving core
Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) from a local server, with
points and progress-tracking, without needing internet connectivity.


Translations
------------

KA Lite is released in many languages, each with its own subset of Khan Academy contents translated: Polish, Georgian, German, Spanish, Xhosa, Indonesian, Burmese, Swahili, Tamil, Hindi, Portuguese (Brazilian and Portuguese), Bulgarian, Danish, Arabic, Bengali, Kannada, and French. See :ref:`adding_languages`.

Documentation: This documentation is also available
`in French (PDF) <http://pantry.learningequality.org/downloads/ka-lite/0.17/docs_fr.pdf>`__.

# KA Lite i18n Documentation
## Everything you ever wanted to know about KA Lite internationalization 

## Hello Standford hackers!
Thanks for your interest in helping with i18n. Your work, combined with that of hundreds of volunteer translators around the world will help make Khan Academy content accessible to billions of non-English speakers around the world without an Internet connection. 

As described on the wiki page, one way to support i18n is to build tools to identify un-marked (or un-wrapped) strings and then wrap them. This is a fairly bite-sized project. After reading through the documentation below, you will hopefully feel pretty comfortable with how internationalization works with Django, and from there can build this tool, and maybe more! Here are some steps to get you started. 

1. Read and follow along with the section [Creating and Testing Interface Translations](#testing-i18n). This section, combined with the linked Django documentation, should give you a decent idea of how internationalization works. 

2. Next, read and follow along with the section [Finding unwrapped strings and wrapping them](#finding-strings). This section will explain how to manually identify un-marked strings, and should give you an idea of how you might be able to do this programmatically. 

3. Finally, read about the [i18n Django management commands](#management) and check them out in the code.

4. Once you've completed the steps above, here are some ways to help (*note*: before getting started, make sure you branch off of the `develop` branch. So you clone the repo, your in the repo, on `master` branch, `git checkout -t origin/develop`, now your on the develop branch, and then `git checkout -b [name-of-hacking-branch]`): 

	- check out the `update_po.py` management command. You will see that there is a flag `-t` whose functionality hasn't been built yet. If this flag is set, the command should read in the contents of freshly generated po files, fill in the translation strings with asterisks (and variable names if they exist) and then recompile the files by running `compilemessages`. See if you can make some progress on this helpful tool! 

	- see if you can improve the overall functionality of the `update_po.py` command. Right now, it requires a lot of background knowledge and intervention. The flags, `-n` / `--new_po` and `-p` / `--post_po` do what they say they will, but are there times they shouldn't be run? For instance, we don't want to run `post_po` if any of the translations have been filled out for the English po file! What about a command to clean out old translations and start fresh? You could build an entire i18n toolkit! Are there other ways to make these commands safer? (hint: definitely - think like a UX designer)


### <a id="testing-i18n"></a>Creating and Testing Interface Translations
Note: many questions about i18n with Django can be answered via the [Django i18n Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/). Also, check out the i18n management commands for shortcuts on following the steps below. 

1. First, make sure you have the [GNU gettext toolset](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) installed. If you have any trouble, try Googling "[How to install GNU gettext toolset for [insert-operating-system-here]](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+I+install+GNU+gettext+toolset+on+Mac)"

2. Next, navigate to the project root directory (e.g. `[local-path-to-ka-lite]/ka-lite/`) note: `ka-lite` is the default if you don't specify a directory when you clone

3. Run the `makemessages` command to generate po files for the languages you want. Read the docs linked above for more info on how this process works. You'll want to ignore the bundled python packages, because they've already been translated and are *big*. It's also a good idea to add the `--no-obsolete` flag to remove outdated strings. Example command: `python kalite/manage.py makemessages -l en --ignore=python-packages/* --no-obsolete` to generate po files for English.  
	- If you follow the example, you should see `processing language en`. This will create a `django.po` file in the `locale/en/LC_MESSAGES` directory.
	- **get an error?**: check out the [common error messages and their solutions](#errors).

4. Run the `makemessages` command again to generate po files for javascript. It's a good idea to ignore any admin static files, as django has taken care of the i18n already. Example: `python kalite/manage.py makemessages -d djangojs -l en --ignore=kalite/static/admin/js/* --ignore=python-packages/* --no-obsolete`.
	- If you follow the example, you should see `processing language en`. This will create a `djangojs.po` file in the `locale/en/LC_MESSAGES` directory.
	- **get an error?**: check out the [common error messages and their solutions](#errors).

5. Inspect the two files you have generated. You should see a bunch of lines like:


	> `#: kalite/central/views.py:85`

	> `msgid "Account administration"`

	> `msgstr ""`


	> **Explanation**: each msgid string is a string in the KA Lite codebase. Each msgstr is where the translation for this language goes. Since this is an English po file and KA Lite is in English, no translation is necessary, but for testing, pick a string to translate into something else. 


6. Find `msgid "Admin"` and translate it to something fun: e.g. `msgstr "What does the fox say?"`

7. Now that we have updated our translations, we need to compile the po files into a mo file so that it can be rendered by Django. To do that, we use the `compilemessages` command. Example: `python kalite/manage.py compilemessages -l en`. 
	- You should see:
		- `processing file django.po in /Users/dylan/Hacking/leq-fork/ka-lite/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES`
		- `processing file djangojs.po in /Users/dylan/Hacking/leq-fork/ka-lite/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES`
	- This command compiles each po file in the `en` language directory and if you've been following along, should have created two new files: `django.mo` and `djangojs.mo`. 

8. Now, restart your local server (`python manage.py runserver`) and check out your translations! Note: Not seeing your translations? It *could* be a caching problem! Try opening in a different browser, clearing your cache, or turning caching off. 

#### <a id="errors"></a> Common Error Messages

- Error: This script should be run from the Django SVN tree or your project or app tree. If you did indeed run it from the SVN checkout or your project or application, maybe you are just missing the conf/locale (in the django tree) or locale (for project and application) directory? It is not created automatically, you have to create it by hand if you want to enable i18n for your project or application. 
	- **Solution**: You need to create an empty `locale` directory in the project root `path-to-kalite/ka-lite/locale/`. After creating, try running `makemessages` again. 

- python: can't open file 'manage.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory. 
	- **Solution**: ensure that when you are running `manage.py` commands from the project root, you specify where to find `manage.py`, e.g. `python kalite/manage.py [command]`


### <a id="finding-strings"></a>Finding unwrapped strings and wrapping them
*This should be done periodically. As the codebase changes, it is likely that user-facing strings will be added, and these will need to wrapped in the appropriate translation tags so that they can appear in our po template files and be translated.*

1. The easiest way to identify unwrapped strings in the codebase is to translate the interface into something wacky like asterisks, and see what's left in plain english. Then you just find that spot in the code, wrap it in translation tags, and move on with your day! Therefore, the first step in this process is following steps 1-5 in the above section [Creating and Testing Interface Translations](#testing-i18n)

2. Once you have fresh new po files, you basically just replace step 6 above with the following: translate every single string into something obviously non-English. For now you could just use a text editor to select all the msgstrs and fill them in with '\*\*\*\*\*'. 

3. Once some msgstrs have been filled in, follow steps 7-8 in the above section [Creating and Testing Interface Translations](#testing-i18n) to compile the translations and view them. 

4. Walk through all of the views in the interface. When you see something in English, you know that string needs to be wrapped. Follow the instructions in the [Django i18n Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/i18n/translation/) to wrap the offending string in the correct translation tags. You can use examples in other parts of the codebase as well for help. 

	**Important**: When running `compilemessages` you will probably run into the error: `a format specification for argument 'variable_name' doesn't exist in 'msgstr'`. Check out the line it specifies in the file. You'll probably see something like `'%(variable_name)s'` in msgid. This is how variables appear. You simply need to copy and paste this variable name (e.g. `'%(variable_name)s'`) into the asterisk filled msgstr. There shouldn't be too many, so doing it manually isn't a killer. E.g. `msgstr "***** '%(facility_name)s'"`. This is just how Django ensures that variables get carried over through the translation process. 


5. Once you think you've found everything, repeat the steps in this section. See if you find anything else. Rinse and repeat! 

6. Once you're done testing, be sure to delete the po and mo files you have created. Translations are not overwritten by creating running the makemessages command, so you will want clear the tests you created so that people using KA Lite in English won't just see a bunch of asterisks :). 


### <a id="management"></a> How to use i18n Management Commands
[Django management command](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-management-commands/) are basically tools you can use from the command line to automate processes. We use them in our code for lots of things: handling video and subtitle downloads for instance. You've used management commands already if you've followed along in the previous sections. `makemessages` and `compilemessages` are built-in Django commands for i18n. You can also write custom management commands. For i18n we have two so far.

#### Command: update_po

- This command is useful for automating some of the processes described below, including generating po files and compiling translations. You can run `python manage.py update_po -h` to see available options.  

#### Command: generate_dubbed_video_mappings

- This command creates a dictionary that maps english videos to dubbed video ids, using the manually curated online Google Docs spreadsheet provided by Khan Academy's i18n team.

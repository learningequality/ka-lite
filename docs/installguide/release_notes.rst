Release Notes
=============

0.17 (unreleased)
-----------------

This is a draft of what will be released. Notes are not fully accurate or final.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

 * Forward admin user to Manage tab after device registration :url-issue:`4622`
 * The bundled ``requests`` library is now version 2.11.1, fixing various download issues :url-issue:`5263`
 * Reduced memory footprint and added PyPy support by not spawning a new interpreter :url-issue:`3399` :url-issue:`4315`
 * Upgrades from 0.15 on a Windows system broke video download :url-issue:`5263`
 * Release `.whl` format on PyPi, it installs faster, it's the future. Users will no longer be warned about Wheel incompatibilities when installing from Pip. :url-issue:`5299`
 * Activating simplified login results in blank login modal :url-issue:`5255`
 * ``favicon.ico`` missing in distributed set of files, little KA green leaf now appears in browser window decorations and shortcuts :url-issue:`5306`

 * Redirect to front page if user logs in from the signup page :url-issue:`3926`
 * Progress bar missing when decimals in progress percentage :url-issue:`5321`


Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * **Windows** needs at least Python 2.7.11. The Windows installer for KA Lite will install the latest version of Python. If you installed KA Lite in other way, and your Python installation is more than a year old, you probably have to upgrade Python - you can fetch the latest 2.7.12 version `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`__.
 * **Windows** installer tray application option "Run on start" does not work, see `learningequality/installers#106 <https://github.com/learningequality/installers/issues/106>`__ (also contains `a work-around`<https://github.com/learningequality/installers/issues/106#issuecomment-237729680>__)
 * **Windows** 8 installation on 32bit is reported to take ~1 hour before eventually finishing.
 * **Development**: Selenium tests on Firefox 48+ needs the new `geckodriver <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver>`__ and the new Selenium 3 beta ``pip install selenium --pre --upgrade``


.. note::
    Code and command cleanups listed below are harmless if you installed KA Lite
    using an installer and only relevant in these cases:
     * You run a specialized setup or deployment
     * Your deployment is 1Â½+ years old
     * You're a KA Lite developer

Code cleanup
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * (List of removed commands)
 * Test coverage is now tracked by Codecov instead of mostly broken Coveralls.io :url-issue:`5301`
 * Fixed unreliable BDD test :url-issue:`5270`
 * Cleaned up deprecated settings ``CONTENT_DATA_PATH`` and ``CONTENT_DATA_URL`` :url-issue:`4813`
 * ``kalitectl.py`` has been removed, instead we invoke ``kalite.__main__`` from ``bin/kalite``.
 * All files distributed as "data files" in ``/usr/share/kalite`` (or similar location) has been removed. It is all located as "package data", meaning that several upgrade issues are fixed moving forwards.
 * The parts of ``kalite.testing`` application that were related to benchmarks. These commands have been unmaintained and are outdated. Now the application's sole focus is utilities for CI.
 * The whole ``kalite.basetests`` application has been removed. It was used to do nonsensical tests of the host system, not actual unit or functional testing.
 * ``kalite.updates.management.commands.classes`` refactored so it doesn't show up as a command ``classes`` (nb: it wasn't a command!).
 * ``python-packages/fle_utils/build``, unused build utility from 2013.
 * The ``manage.py`` script has been removed from the source tree (use ``bin/kalite manage <command>`` instead.)
 * When running KA Lite straight from source, we used some very legacy convetions for data locations. But you can achieve the same effect by specifying a non-default locations using the ``KALITE_HOME`` environment variable. Example: ``KALITE_HOME=/path/to/.kalite kalite start``.
 * PyRun is no longer supported, code that pertained its lacking ``multiprocessing`` has been removed.
 * Static files are only served by Django's HTTP server in ``DEBUG=True`` mode. It was already handled by Cherrypy in other cases, and WSGI deployments are now required to implement this behavior.
 * We no longer release sdists (`tar.gz`) on PyPi, instead only `.whl`. :url-issue:`5299`
 * Unfinished backup commands removed. It's extremely easy to backup and restore (read: **duplicate**) a KA Lite setup, see :ref:`backup`.

Debian/Ubuntu installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Everything in the debconf regarding assessment items has been **removed**. This only has an effect if you had automated deployments. Instead of automating deployments and their content through debconf settings, use your own custom `.kalite` user data directory or invoke `kalite manage retrievecontentpack`. `learningequality/installers#422 <https://github.com/learningequality/installers/pull/425>`__
 * `ka-lite-bundle` now comes bundled with the English content pack `learningequality/installers#422 <https://github.com/learningequality/installers/pull/425>`__
 * No Python files (`*.py`) are placed in `/usr/share/kalite`.
 * Systemd support introduced, fixes specific bug on unupdated Raspbian Jesse `learningequality/installers#422 <https://github.com/learningequality/installers/pull/422>`__


Command cleanup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In 0.17, we cleaned up a lot of unused/broken/deprecated commands,
:url-issue:`5211`.

In case you are using any of them (we hope not), you will have to pay attention
that the following management commands have been removed:

 * ``kalite manage gitmigrate``
 * ``kalite manage katest``
 * ``kalite manage initdconfig``
 * ``kalite manage nginxconfig``
 * ``kalite manage apacheconfig``
 * ``kalite manage todolist``
 * ``kalite manage i18nize_templates``
 * ``kalite manage benchmark``
 * ``kalite manage createmodel``
 * ``kalite manage modifymodel``
 * ``kalite manage readmodel``
 * ``kalite manage runcode``
 * ``kalite manage unpack_asessment_zip``
 * ``kalite manage create_dummy_language_pack``
 * ``kalite manage generate_blacklist``
 * ``kalite manage compileymltojson``
 * ``kalite manage restorebackup``
 * ``kalite manage kalitebackup``
 * Remove ``--watch`` option from ``bin/kalite start`` because ``bin/kalite manage runserver`` does the job. :url-issue:`5314`


0.16.9
------

Bug fixes

 * Installing on Windows 8, 32bit is reported to take ~1 hour before eventually finishing.
 * If you are upgrading from 0.15 on a Windows system, you have to manually locate
   ``python-packages\requests``, typically in
   ``C:\Python27\share\kalite\python-packages\requests`` and delete it (after
   completing the installation process). Otherwise video download breaks.

 * Allow logins during LOCKDOWN :url-issue:`5117`
 * Remove RPI warning message about max number of concurrent downloads, there's no longer a limit on small platforms :url-issue:`4982`

This does not affect the number of exercises and there are still 29,839 assessment items left, so it's not a big concern! :url-issue:`5131`

Known issues

 * Properly copy over docs pages while preserving content pack assets :url-issue:`5074`
      

0.16.0
------

General
^^^^^^^

* KA Lite is officially supported on OSX 10.11 (El Capitan).
* We've revamped the language packs into a new format, called content packs.
  This results in significantly faster startup times across the board.
.. WARNING::
   You will have to redownload all your languages to fully support 0.16.

* We introduced a new beta inline help system. Check this out by going to the
  Facility management page and clicking "Show me how!"
* A lot of UI tweaks and bugfixes. KA Lite is now more stable than ever!

0.15.0
------

General
^^^^^^^

Python 2.6 is no longer supported. It *may* still work, but we are no longer actively supporting it.
Other known issues:

* The latest OSX version (EL Capitan) is not yet supported. KA Lite is officially supported on OS X 10.8 - 10.10.
* On OSX, you must restart the server after downloading videos in order for them to be marked as available.
* On all platforms, you must restart the server after downloading a language pack in order to use it.
* You can no longer configure your server using ``local_settings.py``. Instead, custom settings must appear in
  ``settings.py`` in the user's ``.kalite`` directory.


0.14.0
------

General
^^^^^^^
Installation from source (using ``git``) is no longer supported.
If you have previously installed from source, in order to upgrade you must first install KA Lite again in a new location using one of the supported installers.
Then you can migrate your database and content from your old installation to your new one using the command::

    kalite manage setup --git-migrate=/path/to/your/old/installation/ka-lite

You *must* use the ``kalite`` command that comes with your new installation.
The path you should specify is the base project directory -- it should contain the ``kalite`` directory, which should in turn contain the ``database`` directory.
Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the migration. You should then no longer use the old installation, and should consider deleting it.

0.13.0
------

General
^^^^^^^
Interacting with the system through ``kalite/manage.py`` has now been deprecated. Please use the kalite executable under the ``bin/`` folder. Run ``bin/kalite -h`` for more details.

If you are pulling the source from git, you will need to run the setup command to complete the upgrade. From the base directory run::

    bin/kalite manage setup

On Windows, use the ``bin\windows\kalite.bat`` in the cmd.exe prompt::

    bin\windows\kalite.bat manage setup

When you are asked whether or not to delete your database, you should choose to keep your database! You will also be prompted to download an assessment items package, or to specify the location if you have already downloaded it. If you wish to download the package and specify the location during the setup process:

* Download the assessment items package `here <https://learningequality.org/downloads/ka-lite/0.13/content/assessment.zip>`_. Save it in the same folder as the setup script.
* During the setup process you will see the prompt "Do you wish to download the assessment items package now?". Type "no" and press enter to continue.
* You will then see the prompt "Have you already downloaded the assessment items package?". Type "yes" and press enter.
* Finally, you will see a prompt that begins with "Please enter the filename of the assessment items package you have downloaded". A recommened file may appear in parentheses -- if this is the file you downloaded, then press enter. Otherwise, enter the name of the file you downloaded. (Absolute paths are okay, as are paths relative to the directory you are running the setup script from.)

Windows
^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
    Internet Explorer 8 is no longer supported in this version. Please use a newer browser, or stick to version 0.12 to maintain compatibility.

Raspberry Pi
^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you're updating a current Raspberry Pi installation, make sure to put this in your ``local_settings.py`` to avoid slow performance:

    DO_NOT_RELOAD_CONTENT_CACHE_AT_STARTUP = True

KA Lite Installation Guides
===========================

.. warning:: 

	**KA Lite is no longer under active development**

	Our focus is now on our new learning platform, `Kolibri <https://learningequality.org/kolibri/>`__. If youâ€™re just getting started, we highly recommend using Kolibri instead of KA Lite because it supports more content and will receive regular updates, and more ongoing support.

      New users can experience Khan Academy and much more with Kolibri!	

Installers for a number of platforms are available, each with separate
installation steps. Click ahead for installation instructions, and if you're
updating be sure to check out our release notes.

.. warning:: 

	**KA Lite is no longer under active development**

	Our focus is now on our new learning platform, `Kolibri <https://learningequality.org/kolibri/>`__. If youâ€™re just getting started, we highly recommend using Kolibri instead of KA Lite because it supports more content and will receive regular updates, and more ongoing support.

      New users can experience Khan Academy and much more with Kolibri!						


This guide assumes that you have already downloaded and installed the KA Lite software on your computer. If you have not yet completed these steps, please see the :doc:`../installguide/install_main`.

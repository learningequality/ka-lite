Setting up your development environment
---------------------------------------

KA Lite is like a normal django project, if you have done Django before, you will recognize most of these steps.

#. Check out the project from our _`github`
#. Create a virtual environment "kalite" that you will work in::

     sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper
     mkvirtualenv kalite
     workon kalite

#. Install kalite in your virtualenv in "editable" mode, meaning that the source is just linked::

     cd path/to/repo
     pip install -e .

#. Install additional development tools::

     pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

#. Run a development server and use development settings like this::

     kalite manage runserver --settings=kalite.project.settings.dev


You can also change your ``~/.kalite/settings.py`` to point to ``kalite.project.settings.dev`` by default, then you do not have to specify `--settings=...` every time you run kalite.

Now, every time you work on your development environment, just remember to switch on your virtual environment with ``workon kalite``.

Inline help
===========

In order to write inline help, refer to the file ``kalite/inline/narratives.py``.

You don't have to understand Python to write it really, just reuse the structure
that's already there.

Simple workflow
_______________

You should be able to write inline help for a page following these simple steps:
  
 #. Clone the repository and setup a development environment following the
    steps in :ref:`development-environment`.
 #. Open up the file ``kalite/inline/narratives.py``
 #. Add a new entry of a page you wish to write inline help for, for instance if
    the URL of the page is ``/learn``, then you can add this entry::

      u'learn/?$': [
          {u'#css-id': [
              {u'step': 1},
              {u'text':
                  _(u'This is the explanation for the user')}
          ]},
      ],

    .. note::
      The URL entry is a regular expression. You might want to implement
      variations of the URL in case it can be parameterized. Do not include

 #. After changing the documentation, you can view the results by running the
    development server from command line::

      bin/kalite manage runserver --settings=kalite.project.settings.dev

Once you written inline help, go and open up a Pull Requestion for the ``develop`` branch on our Github page.

Please include the following information when opening an issue:
* The branch you found the issue on
* The current date / the build that the issue affects
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
* Steps to reproduce (be detailed!)

If opening a PR, please observe the following guidelines
* If you're fixing a bug, write a regression test (or have a really good reason for not writing one... and I mean **really** good!)
* Give a brief summary of your changes in the PR description. Add in any other notes that are important for the reviewer to know.
* Update the documentation if your changes affect it (don't just assume they don't)
* Double check your own code for good style
